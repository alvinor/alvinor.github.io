## @author

The @author tag is used to document the author of Structural Elements.

### Syntax

> @author [name] [<email address>]

### Description

The @author tag can be used to indicate who has created Structural Elements or has made significant modifications to them. This tag MAY also contain an e-mail address. If an e-mail address is provided it MUST follow the author¡¯s name and be contained in chevrons, or angle brackets, and MUST adhere to the syntax defined in section 3.4.1 of RFC5322.

### Effects in phpDocumentor

Structural Elements tagged with the @author tag will show an Author header in their description containing the contents of this tag.

If an e-mail address is provided in the tag then the *Author* will link to the mail address instead of displaying it.

### Examples

```php
 /**
  * @author My Name
  * @author My Name <my.name@example.com>
  */
```
