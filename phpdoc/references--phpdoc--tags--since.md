The @since tag indicates at which version did the associated Structural Elements became available.

### Syntax

> @since [version] [<description>]

### Description

The @since tag can be used to indicate since which version specific Structural Elements have become available.

This information can be used to generate a set of API Documentation where the consumer is informed which application version is necessary for a specific element.

The version MUST follow the same rules as the @version tag¡¯s vector and MAY have a description to provide additional information.

This tag can occur multiple times within a PHPDoc. In that case, each occurrence is treated as an entry to a change log. It is RECOMMENDED that you also provide a description to each such tag.

### Effects in phpDocumentor
